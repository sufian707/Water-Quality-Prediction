# Water-Quality-Prediction

Developed a predictive model using LightGBM to assess freshwater potability with high accuracy after rigorous data pre-processing and model evaluation.

The project emphasized key aspects of water quality analysis, including handling class imbalance, outlier detection, and exploring chemical composition factors.

Key steps involved:
Data Cleaning: Processed a comprehensive dataset with key water quality parameters, addressing missing values and ensuring data integrity.

Outlier Detection: Identified and removed outliers to improve the accuracy and reliability of the model.

Class Imbalance Handling: Applied techniques to manage class imbalance in the dataset, ensuring the model accurately predicted both potable and non-potable water.

Feature Engineering: Explored and transformed chemical composition factors like pH, hardness, and organic carbon to enhance the modelâ€™s predictive power.

Model Development: Utilized LightGBM, a gradient boosting framework, to build a predictive model, achieving high accuracy in determining water potability.

Model Evaluation: Assessed model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, ensuring robust prediction results.

Application: The project can be used by water quality monitoring agencies to predict water safety and make informed decisions on water treatment and resource management.
