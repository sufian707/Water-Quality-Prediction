# Water-Quality-Prediction

Developed a predictive model using LightGBM to assess freshwater potability with high accuracy after rigorous data pre-processing and model evaluation.

The project emphasized key aspects of water quality analysis, including handling class imbalance, outlier detection, and exploring chemical composition factors.
